## Introduction:
This project will compare the use of processes and threads by analyzing the performance for some algorithms written in C. Below are the sorting, matching, and series generation algorithms we will use for this purpose.
Methodology:
We will compare this two by using these series algorithms.

1- Damerau–Levenshtein distance 
A string-matching algorithm. It outputs the difference between two strings based on the number of changes required to transform one into the other.

2-Triangular number Series:
A triangular number series that counts the objects that can form an equilateral triangle.
Series: 
 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ….

3-The Lazy Caterer’s Sequence:
It describes the maximum number of pieces (or bounded/unbounded regions) of a circle (a pancake or pizza is usually used to describe the situation) that can be made with a given number of straight cuts
Series:
1,2,4,7,11,16,22,29,37…

4-Catalan Number Series:
The Catalan Number Series forms a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving recursively defined objects.
Series:
1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862…

5-Taylor Series:
A very common sequence to estimate the value of a function given by the formula:
ex = 1 + x + x ^2/2! + x^3/3! + x^4/4! + . . .
